#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM JanSales
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product, 
ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price, 2) AS total_revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY total_revenue desc

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue 
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT acctnum), 
ROUND(AVG(Quantity*price), 2)
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
